      <h3>HS HW Help</h3>
      <p>
        Homework Help catering for years 7 to 12. Specialises in chemistry,
        physics, biology, mathematics extension 1 and 2. What all these subjects
        have in common is a STEM base that demands strong conceptual
        understanding, theoretical reasoning, and the capacity to prime this
        forward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials include trial papers, specific topic questions, difficult
        questions. But due to the nature of my homework help sessions, I highly
        recommend students bring their own materials and difficult questions.
      </p>
      <h4>Pricing:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>$60/h - Year 10 and Under</li>
        <li>$70/h - Year 11 and Year 12 excl. Ext 2</li>
        <li>$80/h - Year 12 incl. Ext 2</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>GAMSAT Tutoring (S2 and S3)</h3>
      <p>
        With a GAMSAT S2 score of 75 and a S3 score of 91, I was able to achieve
        an overall GAMSAT within the 99th percentile. But this came with a
        strong conceptual understanding, one that simply cannot be attained
        through textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials include S2 and S3 practice/prep materials, as well as GAMSAT
        mocks (very limited).
      </p>
      <h4>Pricing:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>$120/h - S2 or S3 tutoring (tailored and flexible)</li>
        <li>$60/paper - S2 Essay Marking/Feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interview Preparation</h3>
      <p>
        Interview preparation can be daunting, and knowing ethical guidelines
        sometimes isn't enough to be unique. Coming from 2 years of personal
        failure, and 3 years of individual growth, I hope I can share some
        insightful information.

        Interviewing at numerous institutions in the past, and being engaged in individual
growth, I understand what it takes to deliver not just a strong response, but a truly
unique response, especially for difficult questions, and ethical dilemmas.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for materials, I have over 40 mocks tailored for different medical
        universities, such as UNSW, UoN, WSU, UniMelb, UQ, Bond as well as
        specific panel questions, and specific MMI scenario questions.
      </p>
      <p>

          (Disclaimer: none of the material are official material, all are
          original and made by me)

      </p>
      <h4>Pricing:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>$150/h - Interview Help Advice</li>
        <li>$175/session - Interview Mock and Feedback</li>
        <li>$250/session - 2x Interview Mock and Feedback</li>

      <h2>Why Choose Me?</h2>

      <h3>Concepts: A strong base builds skyscrapers</h3>
      <p>
        In year 9, I received my rank of 198 out of 210 students. What made me
        jump to rank 105 within just a year was my desire to understand
        concepts. Understanding basic ideas allowed me to prime them forward.
        Theoretical, hypothetical, counter-factual reasoning in mathematics and
        science steadily followed, and with only simple ideas, I was able to
        derive identities with ease, and optimise my problem solving during
        exams. By the end of year 12, I was rank 9, coming rank 2 in mathematics
        extension 1, rank 3 in mathematics extension 2, rank 4 in chemistry and
        rank 9 in physics.
      </p>

      <h3>Practice: Practice makes perfect</h3>
      <p>
        With concepts, it is the continuous practice that reinforces them like
        glue. Having sufficient practice questions with great variety is
        necessary to consolidate understanding and make conceptual learning
        meaningful. Fortunately, through my studies, I have numerous sets of
        questions, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>High School Trial Papers</li>
        <li>Specific Topic Questions</li>
        <li>Difficult Questions</li>
        <li>GAMSAT Materials</li>
        <li>GAMSAT Mock Tests</li>
        <li>Interview Prep Materials</li>
        <li>Over 40 Interview Mocks</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Adapt: Now... I understand it</h3>
      <p>
        If we trip and slip down a mountain, we only see how far we fall. But
        why don't we look at how far we've risen? I've tried for medicine in
        high school, and my first year, but only succeeding at the very end.
        Recovering from failure isn't simply just trying the same path again,
        but sometimes about taking a new pathway. For me, it was always about
        trying something different, and being open to new experiences in the
        now, rather than worrying about the future.
